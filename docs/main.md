# The RAISE package

The RAISE package is an attempt to unify code, and incorporate PEP8 standards. The package takes a modular, object-oriented design, with each part of the ML pipeline encapsulated in a class. The purpose is to allow a streamlined, easy to read interface that allows for explainability of code, to enforce programming standards, and improve maintainability.
